# Brazilian Inflation Analysis | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Period: 2010 - 2026

###  Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory and visual analysis of the **IPCA (Broad Consumer Price Index)**, Brazil's official inflation gauge produced by IBGE. The goal is to identify economic cycles, price shocks, and the index's behavior relative to the inflation targets set by the Central Bank of Brazil.

###  Why this matters
The goal was to practice the full data analysis workflow while working with real-world macroeconomic data.

###  Key Macroeconomic Insights
* **Target Monitoring:** Analysis of the **Inflation Targeting Framework** and its adherence during major cycles.
* **Supply-Side Shocks:** Detailed view of the **2015 (10.7%)** and **2021 (10.1%)** peaks driven by administered prices and global supply chain disruptions.
* **Statistical Outliers:** Identification of the record **1.62% peak in March 2022** and rare deflationary episodes.

###  Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas (Data Wrangling), Matplotlib & Seaborn (Professional Visualization)
* **Reproducibility:** Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

###  Repository Structure
* `Data/`: Raw institutional data.
* `Figures/`: Saved high-resolution visualizations.
* `Notebooks/`: Main Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step analysis.
